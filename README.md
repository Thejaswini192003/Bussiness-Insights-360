# Company Background:

AltiQ Hardware, a global leader in computer and accessory sales, has rapidly expanded its footprint across various markets.The company operates through three main sales channels:

•	Retailers

•	Direct Sales

•	Distributors

Despite this growth, the company recently faced an unexpected loss after launching a store in the NA. This experience highlighted a critical gap in their analytical capabilities, as competitors with robust data analytics teams were making data-driven decisions to optimize their operations. To stay competitive and agile in a data-driven market, AltiQ Hardware recognized the need to establish an in-house analytics team—one capable of delivering insights and driving informed decisions for sustainable success.

# Importing data into PowerBi

In this project, the data is primarily sourced from a MySQL database. To import the datasets into Power BI,
we provided the necessary database access credentials. Additionally, some datasets were obtained from Excel files,
which were also integrated into Power BI for analysis.

# Dimension Tables:

  •	Customer Data: 75 customers across,27 distinct global markets (e.g., India, USA, Spain)
  
  •	Market Data: 27 distinct markets, with sub-zones and regions (APAC, EU, LATAM)
  
  •	Product Data: Multiple divisions, categories, and variants (e.g., Peripherals, Networking, Storage)


# Fact Tables:
  •	Forecast Monthly: Predicts customer needs to optimize inventory and warehouse management.
  
  •	Sales Monthly: Tracks actual sales data, including quantities sold and revenue.
  
  •	Freight Costs: Detailed cost data for transportation and logistics across markets.
  
  •	Gross Price: Pricing details for each product, segmented by category and region.
  
  •	Manufacturing Costs: Includes cost breakdowns by product and fiscal year.
  
  •	Pre/Post-Invoice Deductions: Insights into financial deductions applied pre and post-invoicing.

# Data Modeling:
Data modeling is the backbone of any analytics project. It determines the integrity, speed, and clarity of the reports. Poor data modeling can hamper performance and result in inefficient dashboards. In this project, we adhered to Snowflake Schema best practices for data modeling, ensuring scalability and optimized reporting performance. Well-structured data is key to delivering actionable insights across the board.
This project marks a pivotal moment in AtliQ Hardware's journey toward becoming a truly data-driven organization. By implementing Power BI, we have equipped the company with the tools to make smarter, faster decisions, streamline operations, and ultimately secure a competitive edge in the market. The dashboard not only serves as a source of key insights but also positions AtliQ to respond to business challenges with agility and precision.
